The CRUD application is developed using Nest.js, React.js, Node.js, Sequelize ORM, Axios, Bootstrap, and MySQL. It allows efficient management of data through Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.

Nest.js is a scalable Node.js framework that provides a structured architecture for server-side applications. React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, offering reusable components and dynamic rendering. Node.js is a runtime environment for server-side JavaScript execution. Sequelize ORM simplifies database interactions by defining models and providing data validation and query generation. Axios facilitates HTTP requests between the React.js frontend and Nest.js backend. Bootstrap is a CSS framework offering pre-styled components and utilities for responsive web design. MySQL is a relational database management system used for structured data storage.

The application's functionalities include Create, which validates user input and stores data in MySQL using Nest.js and Node.js. Read retrieves data from MySQL based on queries and sends it to the React.js frontend. Update allows users to modify existing data by receiving changes from the frontend and applying them to MySQL records. Delete identifies and removes records from the database, providing feedback to the React.js frontend.

By utilizing these technologies, developers create robust and responsive applications. Nest.js, React.js, Node.js, Sequelize ORM, Axios, Bootstrap, and MySQL enable seamless integration, efficient data management, and smooth communication between frontend and backend components.
